# Botnet Dissectors

Initial commit of the dissectors for the botnets Sality (v3) and ZeroAccess (v2), developed during my masters thesis. The dissectors are based on the research of Steffen Haas, who reverse engineered the samples in his masters thesis. Also many thanks to my thesis supervisor Dr. Shankar Karuppayah, who supported me during this time.
